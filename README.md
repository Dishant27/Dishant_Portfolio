# Project 1: Football Player Analysis: Project Overview
In this project, we perform descriptive as well as predictive distribution of soccer matches and player performances. 

* Selectors can choose the best players according to their selection parameters and team budget. 
* Players are distributed according to their playing positions and performance.
* The best players with preferred positions and money value are arranged. 
* The need of manual based selection system is completely reduced in this method.
